## Overview

This is a simple **Task Manager web app** that allows users to keep track of their daily tasks.  
Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and clear all tasks when done. The app is built using **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, giving it a clean, modern, and responsive design.

## Features

- Add new tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Clear all tasks  
- Clean and responsive UI with hover effects

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – React framework for building frontend apps  
- **React** – For creating interactive UI components  
- **TypeScript** – Adds type safety for more reliable code  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling  
- **Vercel** – Hosting and deployment

## How It Works

1. Type a task in the input field.  
2. Click **Add** to save the task.  
3. Tasks appear below the input; click on a task to mark it done.  
4. Click **Clear All** to remove all tasks.  

State is managed with React's `useState` hook, and the UI updates dynamically as users interact with the app.
